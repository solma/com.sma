1. Deadlock is a situation in which two or more competing threads acquire each other's lock, and neither thread can enter its
   critical section because it doesn't have its lock. As a result, all threads are blocked while attempting to acquire locks
   to their critical sections and cannot proceed.

   The following application demonstrates deadlocK:

import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;

public class DeadlockDemo
{
   private Object lock1 = new Object();
   private Object lock2 = new Object();

   public void instanceMethod1()
   {
      synchronized(lock1)
      {
         synchronized(lock2)
         {
            System.out.println("first thread in instanceMethod1");
            // critical section guarded first by
            // lock1 and then by lock2
         }
      }
   }

   public void instanceMethod2()
   {
      synchronized(lock2)
      {
         synchronized(lock1)
         {
            System.out.println("second thread in instanceMethod2");
            // critical section guarded first by
            // lock2 and then by lock1
         }
      }
   }

   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      final DeadlockDemo dld = new DeadlockDemo();
      Runnable runnableA = new Runnable()
                           {
                              @Override
                              public void run()
                              {
                                 while(true)
                                 {
                                    dld.instanceMethod1();
                                    try
                                    {
                                       Thread.sleep(30);
                                    }
                                    catch (InterruptedException ie)
                                    {
                                       assert false;
                                    }
                                 }
                              }
                           };
      ExecutorService executorA = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
      Runnable runnableB = new Runnable()
                           {
                              @Override
                              public void run()
                              {
                                 while(true)
                                 {
                                    dld.instanceMethod2();
                                    try
                                    {
                                       Thread.sleep(30);
                                    }
                                    catch (InterruptedException ie)
                                    {
                                       assert false;
                                    }
                                 }
                              }
                           };
      ExecutorService executorB = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
      executorA.submit(runnableA);
      executorB.submit(runnableB);
   }
}

   This application creates a pair of executors that execute different runnables on separate threads. Each runnable invokes
   an instance method, which must acquire a pair of locks before it can enter its critical section.

   Suppose the thread that invokes instanceMethod1() successfully acquires lock1 and the thread that invokes
   instanceMethod2() successfully acquires lock2. The first thread then attempts to acquire lock2, and is forced to wait
   because the second thread holds lock2. Meanwhile, the second thread attempts to acquire lock1, and is forced to wait
   because the first thread holds lock1. Neither thread can proceed and we have deadlock.

   Rewrite this application to demonstrate deadlock in the context of the Lock interface and ReentrantLock class. You'll need
   to replace both pairs of synchronized blocks.

2. Modify the application that you created in the previous exercise to overcome deadlock. Hint: The Lock interface provides
   everything you need.

3. Create a ConcurrentQueue generic type, ConcurrentQueue<E>, that stores elements of type E in a circular queue. Introduce a
   ConcurrentQueue(int capacity) constructor that initializes the queue to a specific capacity. Also, introduce void add(E
   item) and E remove() methods that, respectively, add an item to the queue and remove an item from the queue (returning the
   removed item). Each of add() and remove() should use the java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock interface to lock() and unlock()
   their critical section. Also, when the queue is full, add() should await() on a lessThanFull
   java.lang.concurrent.locks.Condition. When this Condition is signalled, add() can go ahead and add the item. When the
   queue is empty, remove() should await() on a moreThanEmpty Condition. When this Condition is signalled, remove() can go
   ahead and remove the item.

   Use the following application to test ConcurrentQueue:

import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;

public class UseConcurrentQueue
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      final ConcurrentQueue<Integer> cq = new ConcurrentQueue<>(5);
      Runnable r1 = new Runnable()
                    {
                       @Override
                       public void run()
                       {
                          int counter = 0;
                          while (true)
                             try
                             {
                                cq.add(counter++);
                             }
                             catch (InterruptedException ie)
                             {
                             }
                       }
                    };
      ExecutorService e1 = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
      Runnable r2 = new Runnable()
                    {
                       @Override
                       public void run()
                       {
                          while (true)
                            try
                            {
                               System.out.printf("counter = %d%n", cq.remove());
                            }
                            catch (InterruptedException ie)
                            {
                            }
                       }
                    };
      ExecutorService e2 = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
      e1.submit(r1);
      e2.submit(r2);
   }
}

   You should observe output similar to the following:

waiting on moreThanEmpty condition
signalling moreThanEmpty
signalling moreThanEmpty
signalling moreThanEmpty
signalling moreThanEmpty
signalling moreThanEmpty
waiting on lessThanFull condition
signalling lessThanFull
counter = 0
signalling moreThanEmpty
waiting on lessThanFull condition
signalling lessThanFull
counter = 1
signalling moreThanEmpty
waiting on lessThanFull condition
signalling lessThanFull
counter = 2
signalling moreThanEmpty
waiting on lessThanFull condition
signalling lessThanFull
counter = 3
signalling moreThanEmpty
waiting on lessThanFull condition
signalling lessThanFull
counter = 4
...

4. Convert the following expressions to their atomic variable equivalents:

   int result = ++i;
   int result = j--;

5. The java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport class is a utility class that contains basic thread-blocking primitives for
   creating locks and other synchronization classes. For example, this class is used by
   java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer, which is used by java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock.

   LockSupport's Javadoc demonstrates LockSupport by presenting a com.shuoma.lang.concurrent.tutorial.part2.exercises.answers.FIFOMutex class, which is described as a
   "first-in-first-out non-reentrant lock class". Why might you want to use com.shuoma.lang.concurrent.tutorial.part2.exercises.answers.FIFOMutex?

6. com.shuoma.lang.concurrent.tutorial.part2.exercises.answers.FIFOMutex's lock() method evalutes expression waiters.peek() != current || !locked.compareAndSet(false, true) in its while
   loop. Describe what this expression accomplishes.

7. Write a small application that demonstrates com.shuoma.lang.concurrent.tutorial.part2.exercises.answers.FIFOMutex. The application's output should illustrate the FIFO nature of this
   lock.

8. The Java documentation for the java.util.concurrent.RecursiveTask class presents a Fibonacci example that demonstrates a
   recursive task, which returns a result. The task is divided into a pair of subtasks, the left subtask is forked by calling
   ForkJoinTask's void fork() method, the right task is directly executed by calling the overriding V compute() method, and
   both results are merged. Because the left task might still be processing, ForkJoinTask's V join() method is called on that
   task, which returns the result once the task is finished.

   Create a FibForkJoin application that demonstrates Fibonacci. Although there are more performant ways to calculate
   Fibonacci numbers, this exercise gives you an opportunity to experience creating recursive tasks. In contrast, the article
   only shows how to create recursive actions, which don't return results.

9. Extend Listing 8's com.shuoma.lang.concurrent.tutorial.com.shuoma.lang.concurrent.tutorial.part2.exercises.answers.ForkJoinDemo application to also use java.util.Arrays's void parallelSort(long[] a) method to sort the
   array of long integers.

10. What is the purpose of the java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom class?

11. Write an expression that uses ThreadLocalRandom to return an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 50 (exclusive).
