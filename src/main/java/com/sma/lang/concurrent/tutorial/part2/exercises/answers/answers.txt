1. Check out the DeadlockDemo directory for an application that replaces synchronized with Lock and ReentrantLock.

2. Check out the com.shuoma.lang.concurrent.tutorial.part2.exercises.answers.PreventDeadlockDemo directory for an application that's similar to the previous exercise's application but
   uses Lock's tryLock() method to prevent the deadlock scenario from occurring.

3. Check out the ConcurrentQueue directory for the ConcurrentQueue class.

4. The atomic variable equivalent of int result = ++i; is AtomicInteger ai = new AtomicInteger(i); int result =
   ai.incrementAndGet();. The atomic variable equivalent of int result = j--; is AtomicInteger aj = new AtomicInteger(j); int
   result = aj.getAndDecrement();.

5. You might want to use com.shuoma.lang.concurrent.tutorial.part2.exercises.answers.FIFOMutex to prevent a high-priority thread from starving threads of lower priority that are also
   waiting to acquire a lock. Regardless of priority, threads attempting to acquire the lock are queued in first-in,
   first-out order, and only the thread at the head of the queue can acquire the lock.

6. Expression waiters.peek() != current || !locked.compareAndSet(false, true) accomplishes the following:

   1) First determine if the current thread is at the head of the queue. If waiters.peek() != current evaluates to true, the
      current thread is not at the head of the queue, and the while loop's body is entered (to cause the current thread to
      wait by executing LockSupport.park(this)) without the rest of the expression being evaluated (because of short
      circuiting). Only the thread at the head of the queue can acquire the lock.

   2) The current thread is at the head of the queue and can attempt to acquire the lock. AtomicBoolean locked, which is
      initialized to false, is used for this purpose. compareAndSet(false, true) compares locked's current value with false,
      changing this value to true when the value equals false. When the change occurs, compareAndSet() returns true, causing
      !locked.compareAndSet(false, true) to evaluate to false. Because waiters.peek() != current is also false at this point,
      the while loop exits and the lock -- indicated by storing true in locked -- has been acquired.

7. Check out the com.shuoma.lang.concurrent.tutorial.part2.exercises.answers.UseFIFOMutex directory for an application that demonstrates com.shuoma.lang.concurrent.tutorial.part2.exercises.answers.FIFOMutex.

8. Check out the FibForkJoin directory for an application that leverages Fibonacci to demonstrate a recursive task.

9. Check out the com.shuoma.lang.concurrent.tutorial.com.shuoma.lang.concurrent.tutorial.part2.exercises.answers.ForkJoinDemo directory for an application that also uses java.util.Arrays's void parallelSort(long[] a)
   method to sort the array of long integers.

10. The purpose of the java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom class is to provide a random number generator isolated to the
   current thread. Use of ThreadLocalRandom rather than shared Random objects in concurrent programs often results in much
   less thread contention and overhead.

11. The following expression uses ThreadLocalRandom to return an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 50 (exclusive):

    int result = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(50);

    The ThreadLocalRandom current() class method returns the current thread's ThreadLocalRandom instance.
